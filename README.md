# Dutch Open Hackathon 2015, Team Empower

This repository contains the entry for the Dutch Open Hackathon 2015 of Team Empower.

We built an app that enables companies to achieve goals together that would be hard to achieve by themselves.

Using data provided by the Chamber of Commerce, companies can start initiatives and target specific companies in a certain range. Other people can support/endorse an initiative after which further action can be taken.
